# neofetch-dot-file
custom dot file for neofech. This dot file has icons for major linux distros already created for it. simply uncomment your distro of choice and comment out the current one. I am using Pop!_OS, so that is the default distro icon. I also included Windows and MacOS, raspberry pi, and android, so regardless of what OS you are using, there is something for you! Enjoy!

Side note: i3 and hyprland are also included under the WM section of this with icons to match, so just uncomment your WM or DE of choice and comment mine out to get an accurate icon for your build.
 
 This file is icon heavy, to see the icons as they are configured, you will need the monofur nerd font.

 1) install monofur nerd font from:
https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads

 2) create a folder named "monofur" at /usr/share/fonts

 3) unpack zip file at /usr/share/fonts/monofur

 4) set terminal font to monofur
